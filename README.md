# diffur-methods
Runge–Kutta method of order 4.

First function was made for equations, in which second derivative of function depends on this function.

Second funtion is step adaptation, which can speed up your calculations if you need only final result.

Other functions were made for 1-, 2- , 3-dimensional task, in which objects are inpendent from each other characteristics (coordinates, speed).

diffur4.py file shows Runge–Kutta method of order 4 in action.
